# Breakfast React Game
A game to decide whether you'll have waffles or pancakes for breakfast.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAY
    1. Fork repository
    2. Clone repository onto local machine
    3. Open index.html in browser

## HOW TO PLAY
    1. Guess which side the coin will flip to by clicking "Waffle" or "Pancake"
    2. Make 3 guesses
    3. Click "restart" button to restart the game

## Future Ideas
- Include a table to show the history of their coin flips
  - History disappears on page reload, but not on clicking "restart"

- Include a breakfast tic-tac-toe game if coin toss is not challenging enough
  - Same breakfast theme, where waffles and pancakes act as x's and o's
