## Future Ideas
- Include a table to show the **history of their coin flips**:
  - History disappears on page reload, but not on clicking "restart".
- Include a breakfast tic-tac-toe game if the coin toss is not challenging enough:
  - Same breakfast theme, where waffles and pancakes act as x's and o's.
