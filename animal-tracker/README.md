An app that displays a form for a user to log an individual animal sighting. App also displays a list of all animal sightings.
## Features

* Implement data fetching from a database using a GET request
* Parse and display retrieved JSON data in the React frontend.
* Utilize React components, props, and state to manage input states form submission.
* Uses SQL to relate table in a database and grab specific data and records.
* Track form submission and display animal sightings table on Front-end.

## Setup Instructions

1. Project Cloning and Ownership

    * Clone this project repository to your local machine:

        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:nianokia/techtonica-assignments.git
        ```

    * Navigate to the project directory:

        ```bash
        cd animal-tracker
        ```

    * Remove the existing git repository (optional, to establish local ownership):

        ```bash
        rm -rf .git
        ```

2. Install Dependencies

    * **For both the client (frontend) and server (backend) directories:**
        * Navigate to the respective directory:
            * `cd client`
            * `cd server` (after completing client setup)
        * Install required dependencies:

            ```bash
            npm install
            ```

    * This will install all the necessary packages for both the frontend (Vite and React) and backend (Express.js, cors, and nodemon).

3. Create a .env file in the server folder.

4. There are two ways to restore the DB dump file the project already contains:
    * A- If you have postgres set up postgres with an User: 

        * Run the command ```psql -U <user> animal_tracker -f db.sql```
        * Make sure that you have your Postgres password on hand. The psql console will ask for your password.

    * B- If your initial configuration of postgres doesn't require a User:

        * Run the command ```psql animal_tracker -f db.sql```
        * Inside your server folder, open the file .env.example and copy the correct option for your configuration found there to your new .env file.
            * Your .env might look like:
                ```bash
                DATABASE_URI="postgresql://localhost/animal_tracker"
                ```

5. For this template, the name of your db should be animal_tracker.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è If you don't see an animal_tracker db, you can create one. ‚ö†Ô∏è
    * From the terminal, navigate to the psql command line with psql and type:
        ```sql
        create database animal_tracker;
        ``` 

6. Run the App in Browser

    * **Concurrently start Frontend & Backend:**
        * Navigate to the `server` directory:
            ```bash
            npm run dev
            ```

    The app should now be accessible in your web browser at the specified URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Implementation Details

* The `server.js` file will handle the Express server setup and fetch data from database.
* React components will be created in the `client` directory to manage the app interface, form displays, event submission, and list of events.
* Data fetched from the database will be parsed and displayed in the React components.

## Future Implementations
* Display favorite icon to showcase whether the event was favorited or not
* Add custom styling
